   ERDDAP on GCOOS (Docker)
==============================

   ERDDAP has been widely used in the geoscience field, which is used to handle the gridded dataset (e.g. netCDF) or the tabular dataset (e.g. underwater survey). However, it takes some effort and time to work on the installation.  Here, the ERDDAP docker container is built. the ERDDAP container mounts the necessary folders with local storage space.   

To install ERDDAP docker, you can simply use   
```
   docker-compose up -d  
```
